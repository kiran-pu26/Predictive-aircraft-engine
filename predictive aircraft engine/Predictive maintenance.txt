1. Introduction
Predictive maintenance is an advanced maintenance strategy that leverages data analysis and machine learning to predict equipment failures before they occur. This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbine components, which is critical for optimizing maintenance schedules and minimizing downtime. The dataset used in this project includes various operational parameters of turbines, which serve as features for the predictive models.

2. Problem Statement
Industrial operations rely heavily on the continuous and efficient functioning of equipment. Unpredictable equipment failures can lead to significant downtime, safety hazards, and financial losses. Traditional maintenance strategies, such as scheduled maintenance and reactive maintenance, often result in either premature servicing or unexpected breakdowns. The primary challenge is to develop a predictive maintenance system that accurately forecasts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbine components, enabling timely and efficient maintenance interventions.

3. Existing Solutions
Existing maintenance strategies in industrial settings include:

Scheduled Maintenance: Maintenance activities are performed at regular intervals regardless of the actual condition of the equipment. This method often leads to unnecessary maintenance and increased costs.

Reactive Maintenance: Maintenance is performed only after a failure occurs, leading to unexpected downtime and potential safety hazards.

Condition-Based Maintenance: Maintenance is carried out based on real-time monitoring of equipment condition. While more efficient, it requires sophisticated sensors and data processing capabilities.

Predictive Maintenance: Leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failures before they occur. This approach optimizes maintenance schedules and reduces downtime.
